                <h2>My role</h2>
                <p> I Worked as Product Designer in the National Research Infrastructure platform, an initiative from the
                    Ministry of Science and Technology. when I was a UX analyst consultant at Vertigo for The National Education and
                    Research Network.

                <h2>About the platform</h2>

                <p class="caption"><mark>Image: Homepage of the National Research
                    Infrastructure Platform</mark></p>
                <p> The platform gathers information about laboratories and equipment of science and research
                    institutions, enabling researchers to find equipment and facilities across the country and request
                    the use of these resources among different institutions and locations across the country to foster
                    innovation.</p>
                <p> Moreover the Ministry also aims to obtain information and data to promote public policies for the
                    maintenance of existing infrastructures and acquisition of new ones.</p>

                <p>
                    We integrated developer reviews into the discovery phase and switched to using Figma for
                    prototyping. This change promoted collaboration and empowered all parties involved. The client and
                    user validation process became more technical and efficient, and developers were better able to
                    understand the prototype and the user journeys. This process was later refined and implemented in
                    other projects, and Figma became the official prototyping tool for the company.</p>

                <h3>Discovery process</h3>

                <p>The discovery process was composed by a group of diverse users from research institutions
                    who participated in weekly conversations with the product team and the Ministry of
                    Science and Technology (the client).

                <p>
                    we organized rounds for the weekly conversations for each new user journey (e.g. login, advanced
                    search...).
                    The first sessions consisted on discussions to gather requirements of user needs and realities based
                    on
                    the platform business goals and the product current reality.</p>
                <p>With these requirements, the product manager and I as product designer worked on concept prototypes
                    conducting regular feedback sessions to better include stakeholders in the creative process:</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 24px">
                    - With the client and users, we collaborated using the prototypes at figma. This process not only
                    helped
                    us to validate the solutions faster, but also helped them the impact of new
                    features in the business and marketing strategies.</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 24px">
                    - We were looking to provide the developing team more agency in the creative process before was
                    turned
                    into their implementation backlog in addition to give them time to propose proof of concepts and
                    discuss
                    the implementation challenges on a earlier stage.</p>

                <h3>Design and development</h3>
                <p>After the ideas were validated, the prototypes was specified and added to the development backlog. My
                    main responsibilities included defining the user scenarios and interface with
                    the product owner, evolving the design system as necessary, and ensuring the project's assets and
                    content were provided (such as marketing banners and text content).</p>

                <p>After the MVP was launched, we monitored the experience through Google
                    Analytics and users' feedback coming from the support team. We planned and
                    prioritized a new roadmap for the product evolution for the existing features
                    and the strategy to include the new features focused on a new user profile, researchers looking
                    for information on science and research Infrastructures and their sharing possibilities. </p>
