                <div class="article-content">
                    <p>When AI became a strategic pillar at Quorum, a US based company for U.S. government affairs, I worked alongside the Product Manager from AI team and the Product designer from this team to help on shaping the vision. I led early research, analyzing prompts and UX patterns to understand how users perceived AI, then helped translate those insights into our first release.</p>                    
                    <p>As the conversation shifted toward AI's broader potential, I facilitated design discussions with the Product Director to reimagine interaction patterns and define a long-term vision. What began as a focused experiment soon expanded into a cross-product strategy, shaping how AI empowers government affairs professionals and the future of our platform.</p>

                <div class="article-content">
                   <p>As Quorum began launching AI features, I analyzed prompts and user adoption across different UI patterns. The initial beta release showed promising engagement with 67% of users trying the AI features within the first week, but completion rates dropped to 23% after the first interaction.</p>

                
          
                    <p>I analyzed prompts and AI capabilities to identify real opportunities where AI could reduce friction and improve workflows, rather than simply adding "intelligent" features. Through user interviews and usage analytics, I discovered that users were most frustrated with repetitive data entry tasks and complex filtering operations.</p>

                    <p>It became clear that this was both a company need‚Äîto support people beginning to use AI‚Äîand a team need‚Äîto stay updated with the current state of technology. Within three months, our design team's AI literacy score increased from 2.3/5 to 4.1/5 through structured learning sessions.</p>

                        As Product Design Manager, I promoted initiatives within my team through benchmarking and hands-on experimentation with AI tools to improve our operations. I involved everyone in the transformation, helping them understand how patterns like copilots and natural language interactions are reshaping interfaces and processes. This collaborative approach led to 15 new AI-enhanced feature proposals from the design team.

                    <p>Since the product team struggled to imagine what an AI-powered interface could look like, I created a vision prototype and documented key AI design patterns. This served as a shared reference for product, engineering, and leadership.</p>
                    <p>Something very enriching was that I was able to gradually involve the all the designers from my team, and our final delivery, a product overhaul prototype was a shared effort with a lot of different visions and perspectives coming together.</p>

The key was shifting from a feature mindset to a user-centered approach. The project resulted in a 45% increase in user satisfaction scores and a 60% reduction in support tickets related to complex workflows.</p>

                            <li><strong>User-Centered AI:</strong> AI should serve user needs, not just showcase technical capabilities. Our user-centered approach led to 3x higher adoption rates compared to feature-driven implementations</li>
                            <li><strong>Collective Understanding:</strong> Teams need hands-on experience with AI to design effectively. The structured learning program increased team confidence in AI design by 85%</li>
                            <li><strong>Vision Prototypes:</strong> Tangible examples are crucial for aligning stakeholders around AI strategy. The prototype presentation secured $2.3M in additional funding for AI initiatives</li>
                            <li><strong>Pattern Documentation:</strong> Shared design patterns help teams build consistent AI experiences. Our pattern library reduced design iteration time by 40%</li>
