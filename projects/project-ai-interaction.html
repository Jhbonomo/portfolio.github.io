                <div class="article-content">
                    <p>As AI became a strategic pillar at Quorum, I partnered closely with the AI team and its product designer in my role as Product Design Manager, supporting strategy through research and design facilitation.</p>
                    
                    <p>I began by leading UX research, analyzing prompts and studying patterns to uncover critical insights that shaped how users first perceived AI within the product. From there, I collaborated on evaluating our initial release, pinpointing gaps and opportunities to refine the user experience.</p>
                    
                    <p>As the conversation shifted toward how AI could fundamentally reshape Quorum's interface, I worked with the Product Director to reimagine interaction patterns and outline a long-term vision. What started as a focused initiative soon expanded across product and design, guiding how AI could empower government affairs professionals and shape the future of our platform.</p>

                   <p> As Quorum, an enterprise software for U.S. government affairs, began launching AI features, I analyzed prompts and user adoption across different UI patterns.</p><p>Despite common barriers to adopting new technologies, ranging from personal preferences to mistrust. However, embedding small, contextual AI ‚Äúpills‚Äù within the Quorum interface proved highly valuable and became a key driver of adoption.</p>
                   <p>With a complete overhaul of an existing features leveraging AI, some important questions arose towards this change of paradigm</p>
