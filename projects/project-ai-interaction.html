                    <p>When AI became a strategic focus at Quorum, I partnered with the PM and Designer from AI team for the beta launch of the AI chat featre. I led early research on prompts and UX. As scope expanded, I facilitated design discussions with the Product Director to reimagine interactions and define a long-term cross-product AI strategy. </p>

                    <p>It became clear we needed to shift both company mindset toward becoming an AI-driven organization and keep our team aligned with rapid tech evolution. Our design team quickly led the way, becoming one of the first to deliver broader value by actively leveraging AI capabilities.</p>

                        <p>As Product Design Manager, I drove initiatives through benchmarking and hands-on experimentation with AI tools, bringing the entire team into the transformation. I guided designers in exploring how patterns such as copilots and natural language interactions could redefine both interfaces and internal processes.</p>

                    <p>Since the product team struggled to have a holistic view of  what an AI-powered Quorum interface could look like, Product and design team partnered up to create a vision prototype and to document key AI design patterns for Quorum. </p>
                    <p>Because the product team lacked a clear picture of what an AI-powered Quorum interface could be, product and design partnered to create a vision prototype and document key AI design patterns. Leading this future-focused effort, I gradually brought all the designers on my team into the process. The final delivery, a complete product overhaul prototype, was the result of diverse perspectives coming together, and it became a shared reference point for product, engineering, and leadership.

                         <p>As our AI explorations evolved, The challenge wasn't just about adding 'intelligent' features, it was about fundamentally rethinking how we approach product design in an AI-augmented world.</p>

                    <p>We mapped where AI could truly add value‚Äîpinpointing capabilities that genuinely improved the way people worked. Instead of introducing unnecessary complexity, our focus was on reducing friction and removing barriers that slowed users down. Most importantly, we designed AI to seamlessly integrate into existing workflows, enhancing familiar processes rather than forcing people to change the way they already worked.</p>
