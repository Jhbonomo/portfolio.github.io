                <h2 class="section-title">Analyzing the System Usability Scale results</h2>
                <div class="article-content">
                    <p>Looking across multiple years of data uncovered a clear story: the same issues kept resurfacing, and usability scores followed consistent patterns. A closer breakdown of the SUS statements highlighted the real culprits: steep learning curves and overwhelming complexity, both persisting as major barriers.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Unnecessary Complexity</h3>
                    <p>Many workflows were more difficult than they needed to be, creating friction and frustration that went unnoticed internally.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Learnability Gap</h3>
                    <p>The product was conceptually challenging, raising barriers for new users and impacting long-term engagement.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Recurring problems across the years</h3>
                    <p>Reviewing past years made one thing clear: the same usability issues kept resurfacing, signaling a pattern of neglect. This led me to reflect on how to better capture the real impact of usability on a product's success.</p> 
                  

                    <h3>Reporting on system-wide challenges</h3>
                    <p>In my presentation, I reframed the recurring problems as critical risks rather than minor inconveniences, making their weight harder to ignore. The next challenge, however, goes beyond identification: it's about stepping back and finding ways to measure how usability shapes adoption, retention, and the risk of customer churn.</p>

                    <p>Additionally, focusing on the system-wide challenges of learnability and complexity, I created a report that mapped the factors driving these issues. To address recurring problems, I conducted a deeper analysis of the specific features driving these difficulties in the Feature assessment.</p>

                    <p>To operationalize this, I introduced a <strong>usability debt board</strong>, a structured backlog of high-value issues categorized by effort levels.
